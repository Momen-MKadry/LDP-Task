# Debian Main Points
----
### Debian History  
- Developed by the community-supported Debian project (established by Ian Murdock in 1993).
- One of the oldest operating systems based on Linux kernel (Released in 1993).
- Its the basis for many other distributions (Ubuntu, Mint, Kali, Pop-Os).

### Pros & Cons
- ##### Pros
	1. **Free and Open-Source Software**
		- Which provied competitive advantages.
		- Used in government agencies, non-profit orgs and profit or commercial orgs (banks, tech companies).
	2. **Support Different System Architectures**
		- Means it can run on older and neewer systems.
		- Other linux distros have limited compatibility (ex. Fedora dropped support for older architectures).
		- **Note:** If Debian does not run on particular hardware, chances are, other distributions will not.
	3. **Ideal for those who are looking for an alternative for *Windows* and *macOS*.**
	4. **Stable and Secure**
		- Because it's maintained by an established and mature community of developers.
		- It takes two to three years for the community to release a **Major Update**, to ensure that the newest version is stable and bugs-free.
- ##### Cons
	1. **Conservative OS**
		- Lags in terms of introducing new features that are already avaliable to other linux distros (due to the large gaps between **Major Updates**).
		- Not user-friendly according to others.
		- Basic GUI framework, but most complex tasks can only be done in terminal.
	2. **Issue with GNU Principles**
		- Conscientiously keeps non-free software out of its official system.
	3. **Installing additional hardware configurations is complicated.**
	4. **Absence of popular proprietary or commercial software**
		- This can be a problem for those  accustomed to using specific software. 
		- Transitioning to this system can become a problem.
		
### Who's It For?
- Might be complicated for beginner, however if you're willing to read documentation and do some googling then you're good to go.
- "If you don’t mind reading documentation and asking questions on forums or chats, then you should not have an issue using Debian. However if you don’t want to run into issues and just want it to work, you’d be much better off with Linux Mint."  -Linux Power User
